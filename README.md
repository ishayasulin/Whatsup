# Advanced Programming 2 - Ex 3

In this task we created the chatting app from the previous tasks as an android app:

- We used a completely new design which is adjusted to the shape of an average android.
- Most features from the web app remained the same with minor additions.
- A settings page exists, the user can change the design and the server address as he desires.
- Refreshing the contacts page is possible.
- we assume that the images will not be too large
- we send the registration token in the header of the login request. and we expect the data that the server sent to contain the sender username in the tutle and the content in the body and in the data the id of the chat that the message sent to.
  

  # How to run
- Run your server
- Clone the repository
- Open it in android studio
- Config an emulator or phone
